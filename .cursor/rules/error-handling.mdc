# Error Handling

- Always handle errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Don't suppress errors silently unless explicitly intentional
- Log errors appropriately (console.error for errors, console.log for info)
- Use the `safePageOperation` wrapper for all Puppeteer page operations

## Puppeteer-Specific Error Handling
- Use `safePageOperation` wrapper for all page operations
- Handle frame detachment errors gracefully
- Filter out harmless browser console errors
- Use appropriate wait times and timeouts
- Save HTML for debugging only in dev mode

# Code Quality & Standards

## General Principles
- Write clean, maintainable, and high-quality code
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles - extract common functionality into reusable functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly express intent
- Add JSDoc comments for all functions, especially exported ones
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer composition over duplication

## Code Style
- Follow the existing code style and ESLint configuration (Airbnb base)
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (as configured in .eslintrc)
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Handle errors appropriately with try/catch blocks
- Use descriptive error messages

## DRY Principles
- Extract repeated code patterns into utility functions
- Create shared helper functions in `lib/utils.js` when functionality is used in multiple places
- Avoid copy-pasting code - refactor instead
- Use constants for magic numbers and repeated strings
- Consolidate similar functions when possible

## File Organization
- Keep related functionality together
- Place shared utilities in `lib/utils.js`
- Keep functions modular and focused
- Export only what's necessary from each module

## Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Prefix private/internal functions with `_` if needed (but prefer module exports)
- Use constants for configuration values

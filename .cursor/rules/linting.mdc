# Linting Requirements

## Always Run Lint
- **MANDATORY**: Always run `npm run lint` after making code changes
- Fix all linting errors before committing
- Use `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix fixable issues
- Never commit code with linting errors
- If you introduce new code, ensure it passes linting checks

## Linting Workflow
1. Make code changes
2. Run `npm run lint` to check for errors
3. If errors exist, run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix
4. Manually fix any remaining errors
5. Verify all linting passes before proceeding

## Pre-Commit Checklist
- [ ] Code changes complete
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] No linting errors or warnings
- [ ] Code tested and working

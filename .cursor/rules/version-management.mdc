# Version Management

## Package.json Version Updates
- **MANDATORY**: Always update the `version` field in `package.json` after making changes
- Follow semantic versioning (semver):
  - **PATCH** (x.x.X): Bug fixes, minor improvements, non-breaking changes
  - **MINOR** (x.X.x): New features, backward-compatible changes
  - **MAJOR** (X.x.x): Breaking changes, major API changes
- The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically create a release when version changes

## Version Update Workflow
1. Make code changes
2. Determine version bump type (patch/minor/major)
3. Update `package.json` version field accordingly
4. Run linting and fix any issues
5. Commit changes (version bump should be in the same commit as code changes)
6. Push to trigger GitHub Actions release

## Example Version Updates
- Bug fix or small improvement: `1.0.0` → `1.0.1` (patch)
- New feature: `1.0.1` → `1.1.0` (minor)
- Breaking change: `1.1.0` → `2.0.0` (major)

## Important Notes
- Version updates are REQUIRED after any code changes
- The GitHub Actions workflow (`/.github/workflows/release.yml`) monitors `package.json` changes
- A new release will be automatically created when version changes
- Version bump should be included in the same commit as the code changes

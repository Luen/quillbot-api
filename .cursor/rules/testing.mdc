# Testing & Verification

- After making changes, verify functionality works as expected
- Test with `node example.js` when applicable
- Ensure no regressions are introduced
- Check that error cases are handled properly
- Verify that both paraphrasing and translation examples work correctly

## Verification Steps
1. Run `node example.js` to test both paraphrasing and translation
2. Check console output for any unexpected errors
3. Verify output quality matches expectations
4. Ensure no browser console errors (except known harmless ones)
